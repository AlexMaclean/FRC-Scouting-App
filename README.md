[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IronRiders/FRC-Scouting-App.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IronRiders/FRC-Scouting-App)

This is a scouting app built by Alex MacLean and Tobias Rohde, members of team 4180, the Iron Riders. It is built to collect, view and share scouting data about teams in the 2017 FRC game Steamworks. It uses Bluetooth connections to share infromation in order to circumvent poor network connections at competitions.
